## Theory

- Repeated what is Stack and how does it work.
- Learned Passing by Reference.
- Remembered how to work with recursion funcs correctly
- Learned Euclidean algorithm for GCD and LCM
- Checked shuffle function for arrays
- Learned intdiv, strrev function
- Understood differences between fuctions: in_null, empty, isset

## Practice

1. Created class Stack with basic function based on singly linked list
2. Created recursive function GCD, LCM, Fubonacci
3. Created sorting functions (Bubble, Merge, Quick) and value binary search
4. Created converter number system (Decimal/Binary)
5. Created class Tree, being Binary Tree
